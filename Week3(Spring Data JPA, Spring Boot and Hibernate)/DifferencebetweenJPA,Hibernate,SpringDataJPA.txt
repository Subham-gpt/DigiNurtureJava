JPA (Java Persistence API)
-- A Java interface for object-relational mapping (ORM)
-- You annotate your entities with @Entity, @Id etc.
-- JPA defines how to persist objects, but doesnâ€™t perform any action by itself.

Hibernate

-- Provides the actual logic to persist objects to the DB.
-- It maps Java classes to DB tables.

Spring Data JPA
-- A Spring project that sits on top of JPA.
