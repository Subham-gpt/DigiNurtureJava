--Recursion means a method calling itself. 
--Each time it calls itself, it works on a smaller part of the 
  original problem â€” until it reaches a base case, which stops the recursion.
--Recursion helps to simplify complex nested structured problems.
-- Example:
      int factorial(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;          
      return n * factorial(n - 1);     
      }
