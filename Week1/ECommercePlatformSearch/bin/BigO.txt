Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time as the input size grows. 
It helps you understand how your code will perform at scale.

 Notation       |        Meaning
 ------------------------------------	           
  O(1)	        |     Constant time
  O(n)	        |      Linear time
O(log n)	    |    Logarithmic time
O(n log n)	    |    Linearithmic time
  O(nÂ²)	        |      Quadratic time



Best, Average, and Worst-Case in Search:

| Algorithm  | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
|   Linear   | O(1)      | O(n)         | O(n)       |
|   Binary   | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(log n)   |

Best Case: Item is at the first position (for linear), or in the middle (for binary).

Worst Case: Item is not present or at the end.

Average Case: On average, how long it takes assuming uniform distribution.




Recommendation:

--Use Linear Search for small or unsorted data.

--Use Binary Search for large and sorted arrays, which makes it ideal for scalable e-commerce platforms.
